Title: Colorize R output on terminal emulators
Author: Jakson Aquino
Maintainer: Jakson Alves de Aquino <jalvesaq@gmail.com>
OS_type: unix
Description: Colorize R output when it is running on a terminal emulator.
   There is no support for Graphical User Interfaces, such as Windows RGui,
   RStudio, RKward, JGR etc. The functions of this package only work if R is
   compiled for Unix systems and it is running interactively in a terminal
   emulator. The terminal must support Select Graphic Rendition (SGR, also
   known as ANSI escape codes or sequences). The package contains a C library
   with a function that replaces the default Rstd_WriteConsoleEx which, when
   enabled, is responsible for printing messages in the Console when R is
   running in interactive mode.
